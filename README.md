# ðŸ–‹ Sans Language
This project is about me losing the passion for what I do and refinding it through writing. I got inspired by a photo from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/portbox/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Portbox</a>.

The goal of this project was to practice type and layout. See [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/MartijnKeesmaat) for the full-page design.

For the interactions, I experimented with a loading screen, navigation and image distortion effect. 

You can play around with the demo <a href="https://martijnkeesmaat.github.io/codename-language/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/codename-language" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code</a>

Without(sans) language there is no thought
